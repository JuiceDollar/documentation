# Background FAQ
**Some questions we think might get frequently asked.**

### What is this all about?

From a bird's eye perspective, the JuiceDollar system resembles a bank that creates money against collateral. In the traditional banking system, this can for example be done with real estate. The bank accepts a house as collateral, and prints the agreed amount of money by adding it to that persons bank account. Then the buyer of the house can transfer the money to the seller, where it ends up as a deposit with maybe the same or another bank, thereby closing the circle. When doing so, banks need to observe some reserve and other legal requirements to ensure the mortgage is well-secured. The JuiceDollar system essentially enables users to do the same, printing some money against a (hopefully) valuable collateral. Also, like a bank, the JuiceDollar system has a reserve pool that resembles the equity capital of a bank and serves as a buffer to absorb risks. However, in contrast to a bank, there is nothing that qualifies as credit as the users print their money themselves, processes are largely automated and fully transparent, and there is no explicit governance besides a veto mechanism that is open for everyone with enough pool shares.

### Is this useful?

If used with the necessary care, most definitely. Most of the usefulness of JuiceDollar comes from its decentralized nature. It is open, fully transparent, and freely interactible by humans and software alike. Thanks to its transparency, anyone can analyze its solvency at any moment. If it is in imbalance, it can be expected to be attacked by speculators who know exactly at which market prices JuiceDollar is not fully backed any more. The goal is not to imitate traditional banking, the goal is to create something immanently better.

### Is this political?

Yes, a little. Today's system of money creation distorts capital allocation. To illustrate the problem, consider the example of a farmer who is faced with the choice of planting apple trees or pear trees. Apple trees come with a return of 5% per year, and pear trees with a return of 7%. So the optimal allocation clearly is to go for pears. However, if the farmer needs a credit to finance her project and banking regulation only allow banks to recognize apple trees as collateral, then the farmer will actually go for apples. For example, if the interest is 3% and the farmer can borrow up to 75% of the value of the apple trees, the return on equity on the leveraged position is 11%. That way, apples become the rational choice, even though it would be better for society to plant pear trees.

That's how the regulators that define capital requirements for banks implicitely influence the resource allocation of the economy, leading to a worse outcome than in a free and open market. In particular, today's capital requirements push exorbitant amounts of capital into real estate and government bonds. Next in line are large corporations, followed by smaller business. Venture capital and crypto projects are at the very bottom of the food chain. Fortunately, blockchain technology offers a way out. It allows us to try to build something better outside the broken traditional financial system. With JuiceDollar, we want to return the power of the creation of money to the people, enabling anyone to mint their own cash. This can lead to a stronger economy and more growth, if the system is used responsibly.

### What is the connection to the cypherpunk movement?

JuiceDollar stands in the tradition of the cypherpunk movement - a group of activists who, since the late 1980s, have advocated for privacy and financial freedom through cryptography.

**The Cypherpunk Manifesto (1993) states:**
> "We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence."

JuiceDollar realizes these ideals:

- **"Cypherpunks write code"** → Our smart contracts are the law, not regulators
- **Financial sovereignty** → Mint your own money against your own collateral
- **Trustless systems** → No oracles, no intermediaries, no gatekeepers
- **Permissionless access** → Anyone can participate without approval

The project continues the work of pioneers like Timothy C. May, whose "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" (1988) envisioned:
> "A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy... the technology for this revolution... has existed in theory for the past decade."

Bitcoin was the first major realization of this vision. JuiceDollar extends it to decentralized stablecoins - enabling dollar-denominated value storage and transfer without centralized control.

### Is JuiceDollar a security?

No, it neither qualifies formally nor functionally as a security. It does not qualify formally as a security under Swiss law as it does not represent a claim towards an issuer. Also, it does not qualify functionally as a security as it does not serve a financing purpose.

### When obtaining JuiceDollar against a collateral, is that really _borrowing_?

We are having an ongoing debate on whether the term "borrow", "mint", or something entirely different should be used. "Borrow" is more intuitively understandable, but it implies the presence of a counterparty and by extension that the JuiceDollar system is a legal entity - which it is not as the law does not recognize distributed systems as such. Also, the term "borrow" is usually applied to things that already exist before they are being borrowed. So the alternative term that could be used is simply "mint", which is technically correct as that is what happens when obtaining JuiceDollars against a collateral: new tokens are being minted using the mint function of the JuiceDollar smart contract. However, the term "mint" does not cover everything that is happening, so while it is more accurate than "borrow", it is less complete. "Borrow" correctly implies that at some point in time, the created JuiceDollars need to be returned, which "mint" does not. Given the choice between the more complete but slightly misleading "borrow" and the more accurate but incomplete "mint", we decided to label the according buttons "borrow".
